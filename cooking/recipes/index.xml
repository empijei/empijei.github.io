      <description>How simple can it be? This recipe can be simplified to literally be &amp;ldquo;mix all together; bake&amp;rdquo;.
About the Chestnut paste This is not easy to come by outside of Switzerland but it is a 74% boiled chestnuts 26% sugar mix, so I think this should be fairly easy to make at home (but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried).
This is how the ingredient I use looks like: </description>

      <description>If you want to give your cookies the coffee taste, the water can be replaced completely or partially with the same amount of dark coffee.
This recipe does not require baking nor the usage of knives, therefore is suitable for cooking with kids.</description>

      <title>Carbonara</title>

      <description>Cream? No cream? The cream is not in the original recipe but it makes it much easier to obtain a creamy sauce and reduces the risk of scrambling the eggs. I would suggest trying with the cream the first few time you make this and then move on to the traditional version.
Sometimes when I make brioche I end up with some leftover yolk-cream mix and to not throw it away I add it to the whole egg to make a carbonara, it is not the traditional way but I hate to throw away good ingredients.</description>

      <description>Doses are per person, I suggest making it for at least two people.
Flavors Flavors can be composed, like sausage and mushrooms or sausage and saffron, let your fantasy guide you.
 Saffron (use red wine with tannins like salice, primitivo or any non-sweet red wine) Sausage (in this case add the sausage 5 minutes before the end) Squid ink Pumpkin Zucchini and shrimps Cheeses Radicchio  </description>

      <title>Crema Pasticcera [~Custard]</title>

      <description>IMPORTANT NOTE Be careful when you reheat the mix: it will take a while for it to change viscosity, but it will happen very quickly. If you are not quick enough to take it off the heat you might end up with scrambled eggs. If that happens you can still blend the mix but it will not have the right consistency.
Make also sure to constantly whisk, otherwise your custard will burn or make lumps.</description>

      <description>They can be preserved at room temperature for roughly a week. I strongly advise against freezing.
I think they are best after one or two days, not immediately after made.</description>

      <description>This paste has a high content of umami, which can be used to enhance and prolong a taste.
It can be easily stored in the freezer in an ice-cube mold for later use.</description>

      <description>Panzanella is a good way to put your stale bread to good use: nothing goes to waste!
The two optional ingredients are not from the original recipe, but they are a twist I added.
Keep in mind that ingredients and quantities are just a suggestion: feel free to customize this recipe as much as you like!</description>

      <description>Preservation Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.
Vegan For a ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground cashew nuts.
Faster For a faster alternative you can put all ingredients in a food processor.</description>
