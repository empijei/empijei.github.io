      <description>About this cake and its variants This is one of my favorite recipes:
 The effort is very low and the result is amazing It is gluten free so it can accommodate guests that have trouble with it It can even be made lactose-free if butter is replaced with lactose-free butter or margarine and all the white chocolate is replaced by dark chocolate.  How to melt chocolate and butter Bain-marie Bain-marie is my favorite way to melt chocolate for most recipes as it makes it close to impossible to burn chocolate.</description>

      <description>This paste has a high content of umami, which can be used to enhance and prolong a taste.
It can be easily stored in the freezer in an ice-cube mold for later use.</description>
