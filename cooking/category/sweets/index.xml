      <description>About this cake and its variants This is one of my favorite recipes:
 The effort is very low and the result is amazing It is gluten free so it can accommodate guests that have trouble with it It can even be made lactose-free if butter is replaced with lactose-free butter or margarine and all the white chocolate is replaced by dark chocolate.  How to melt chocolate and butter Bain-marie Bain-marie is my favorite way to melt chocolate for most recipes as it makes it close to impossible to burn chocolate.</description>

      <description>How simple can it be? This recipe can be simplified to literally be &amp;ldquo;mix all together; bake&amp;rdquo;.
About the Chestnut paste This is not easy to come by outside of Switzerland but it is a 74% boiled chestnuts 26% sugar mix, so I think this should be fairly easy to make at home (but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried).
This is how the ingredient I use looks like: </description>

      <description>If you want to give your cookies the coffee taste, the water can be replaced completely or partially with the same amount of dark coffee.
This recipe does not require baking nor the usage of knives, therefore is suitable for cooking with kids.</description>

      <title>Crema Pasticcera [~Custard]</title>

      <description>IMPORTANT NOTE Be careful when you reheat the mix: it will take a while for it to change viscosity, but it will happen very quickly. If you are not quick enough to take it off the heat you might end up with scrambled eggs. If that happens you can still blend the mix but it will not have the right consistency.
Make also sure to constantly whisk, otherwise your custard will burn or make lumps.</description>

      <description>They can be preserved at room temperature for roughly a week. I strongly advise against freezing.
I think they are best after one or two days, not immediately after made.</description>
