      <description>Cream? No cream? The cream is not in the original recipe but it makes it much easier to obtain a creamy sauce and reduces the risk of scrambling the eggs. I would suggest trying with the cream the first few time you make this and then move on to the traditional version.
Sometimes when I make brioche I end up with some leftover yolk-cream mix and to not throw it away I add it to the whole egg to make a carbonara, it is not the traditional way but I hate to throw away good ingredients.</description>

      <description>Doses are per person, I suggest making it for at least two people.
Flavors Flavors can be composed, like sausage and mushrooms or sausage and saffron, let your fantasy guide you.
 Saffron (use red wine with tannins like salice, primitivo or any non-sweet red wine) Sausage (in this case add the sausage 5 minutes before the end) Squid ink Pumpkin Zucchini and shrimps Cheeses Radicchio  </description>
