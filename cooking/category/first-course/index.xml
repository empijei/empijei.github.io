      <description>Cream? No cream? The cream is not in the original recipe but it makes it much easier to obtain a creamy sauce and reduces the risk of scrambling the eggs. I would suggest trying with the cream the first few time you make this and then move on to the traditional version.
Sometimes when I make brioche I end up with some leftover yolk-cream mix and to not throw it away I add it to the whole egg to make a carbonara, it is not the traditional way but I hate to throw away good ingredients.</description>
