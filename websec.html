                <p>
                    I've been working in web security for 10 years now and I've spent
                    countless hours of my spare time trying to dig deeper and deeper into
                    the topic.<br />
                    Has it been worth it? I don't know, but I thought it might be of some value
                    sharing
                    some of my knowledge with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been thinking about the format for a while now, and I realized that a guide
                    or a blog or a wiki wouldn't quite represent what's in my head.<br />
                    Security, especially web security, is a very advanced collection of
                    technologies, most of which seem completely unrelated and glued
                    together with duct tape. In fact, some of them are.<br />
                    I think we are at a stage where almost no one in the world fully grasps the
                    whole picture of what a user agent actually has to do in order to display a
                    kitten GIF on a web chat.<br />
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="content"> «Any sufficiently advanced technology is
                        indistinguishable from magic.» </p>
                    <p class="author">Arthur C. Clarke</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    I tend to agree with Clarke on this one, and I think that web security
                    definitely
                    falls into this area of obscurity.<br />
                    This document should, therefore, be seen as a grimoire of spells
                    you can use to protect your websites and applications. It's not a guide,
                    it's not comprehensive and it's not perfect, but some of the incantations will
                    get you very far in making your attackers' life harder.<br />
                    Remember that a web application can never be <i>secure</i>, it can only be
                    <i>secure
                        enough</i>.<br />
                    If you use the magic in here, you'll probably go a long way towards
                    achieving that goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If what I've written so far seems too far-fetched and you think that the web
                    platform is
                    actually simple, I'll leave a quote here, and you can decide
                    whether it looks like an extract from a fantasy novel or the HTML specification.
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="content centered shadowed">
                        A shadow tree is a node tree whose root is a shadow root.<br>
                        A shadow root is always attached to another node tree through its host.<br>
                        A shadow tree is therefore never alone.<br>
                        The node tree of a shadow root's host is sometimes referred to as
                        the&nbsp;light&nbsp;tree.<br>
                        A shadow tree's corresponding light tree can be a shadow tree itself.<br>

            <h1 id="xss">On how to protect from Cross-Site Scripting, AKA&nbsp;XSS</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>First of all, let's be clear: XSS is improperly named. There is some scripting, but
                it's not really cross-site.
                XSS is just about adding some undesired code to a page. Undesired for the owner,
                that is.<br>
                There are various approaches to defend against XSS, and I would personally suggest
                them all, but if the budget is tight, please apply them in the order they appear (if
                possible).
            </p>
            <h2 id="xss-templates">Strict Templates
            </h2>
            <p> In order for a template system to be defined "strict" it needs to be
                Typesystem-Enforced, Context-Aware and with mandatory Auto-Escaping
                I know that's a mouthful, but we're doing magic, not poetry.<br>
                Let's break it down:
            <dl>
                <dt>Typesystem-Enforced</dt>
                <dd>
                    Templates should not accept runtime strings as sources, but only as
                    arguments.<br>
                    Only compile-time constants and string derived from similarly trusted inputs,
                    like
                    startup flags or storages under the programmer control, should be allowed as
                    template sources.<br>
                    Similarly, in order to construct strings that bypass the escaping, only trusted
                    sources should be allowed.<br>
                    This means that, in addition to the sources that would be trusted to create a
                    template, one can also accept
                    the output of encoders and sanitizers.<br>
                    When I talk about encoders I mean that if you encode a string to be interpolated
                    <!-- TODO(empijei): sanitizers and how to make them -->
                    <!-- TODO(empijei): safe responses -->
                </dd>
                <dt>Context-Aware</dt>
                <dd>
                    When the template performs escaping, it should be aware of the context strings
                    appear in. Escaping data that appears in a <code>style</code> tag is very
                    different from doing it for a <code>href</code> attribute of an anchor.
                    The template should use different escapers for different contexts, and reject
                    interpolation for contexts it can't escape for.
                </dd>
                <dt>Auto-Escaping</dt>
                <dd>
                    Escaping should be automatic and always enabled. It should be impossible to
                    accidentally
                    use a template and not enable escaping.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            </p>
